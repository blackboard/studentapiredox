            the default campus, and the document status Code is set to “OK” or
            “REC”, then DNC Override will be set for all Contact Method sources.

            The 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) selected by the
            student. The portal requires the student to enter his or her Student
            ID and PIN to log in. If you do not specify the PIN or change the
            social security number, the program defaults the PIN to the last
            four numbers of the social security number. If the last four
            characters begin with a zero, the PIN defaults to a 1 followed by
            the last 3 characters of the number. For example, if the last 4
            digits of the social security number are 0398, the PIN is 1398.
