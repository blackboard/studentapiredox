            The work telephone number for the student. The format will depend on
            how your institution configured phone numbers (such as whether or
            not it uses parenthesis and hyphens). When a student is placed in a
            job using student placement, the program automatically updates the
            number with the phone number for the employer. If it applies, the
            extension is also updated.
